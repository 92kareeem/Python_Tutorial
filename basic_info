Our Python tutorial thoroughly explains Python basics and advanced concepts, starting with installation, conditional statements, loops, built-in data structures, Object-Oriented Programming, Generators, Exception Handling, Python RegEx, and many other concepts. This tutorial is designed for beginners and working professionals.

History of Python : 

- The first version of Python 0.9.0 was released in 1991.
- In January 1994, Python 1.0 was released as a usable and stable programming language. This version included many of the features that are still present in Python today.
- From the 1990s to the 2000s, Python gained popularity for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. In October 2000, Python 2.0 was released. Python 2.0 introduced list comprehensions, garbage collection, and support for Unicode.
- In December 2008, Python 3.0 was released. Python 3.0 introduced several backward-incompatible changes to improve code readability and maintainability.
- Throughout 2010s, Python's popularity increased, particularly in fields like data science, machine learning, and web development. Its rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks made it a favourite among developers.
- The Python Software Foundation (PSF) was established in 2001 to promote, protect, and advance the Python programming language and its community.

What is Python?
Python is a general-purpose, dynamically typed, high-level, compiled and interpreted, garbage-collected, and purely object-oriented programming language that supports procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

Features of Python:

-Easy to use and Read 
-Dynamically Typed - The data types of variables are determined during run-time. We do not need to specify the data type of a variable during writing codes.
-High-level - High-level language means human readable code.
-Compiled and Interpreted - Python code first gets compiled into bytecode, and then interpreted line by line. CPython is considered to be Complied and Interpreted both.
-Garbage Collected - Memory allocation and de-allocation are automatically managed. Programmers do not specifically need to manage the memory.
-Purely Object-Oriented - It refers to everything as an object, including numbers and strings.
-Cross-platform Compatibility - Python can be easily installed on Windows, macOS, and various Linux distributions, allowing developers to create software that runs across different operating systems.
-Rich Standard Library - Python comes with several standard libraries that provide ready-to-use modules and functions for various tasks, ranging from web development and data manipulation to machine learning and networking.
-Open Source
- Expressive Language: It allows programmers to express complex concepts in just a few lines of code or reduces Developer's Time.
- Interpreted Language: Python does not require compilation, allowing rapid development and testing. It uses Interpreter instead of Compiler.
- Object-Oriented Language: It supports object-oriented programming, making writing reusable and modular code easy.
- Extensible: Python can be extended with modules written in C, C++, or other languages.
- Integrated: Python can easily integrate with other languages and technologies, such as C/C++, Java, and . NET.
- Embeddable: Python code can be embedded into other applications as a scripting language.
- Versatility: Python is a universal language in various domains such as web development, machine learning, data analysis, scientific computing, and more.
- Large Community: Python has a vast and active community of developers contributing to its development and offering support. This makes it easy for beginners to get help and learn from experienced developers.
- Career Opportunities: Python is a highly popular language in the job market. Learning Python can open up several career opportunities in data science, artificial intelligence, web development, and more.
- High Demand: With the growing demand for automation and digital transformation, the need for Python developers is rising. Many industries seek skilled Python developers to help build their digital infrastructure.
- Increased Productivity: Python has a simple syntax and powerful libraries that can help developers write code faster and more efficiently. This can increase productivity and save time for developers and organizations.
- Big Data and Machine Learning: Python has become the go-to language for big data and machine learning. Python has become popular among data scientists and machine learning engineers with libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and more.
